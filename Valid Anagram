## Valid Anagram

Two strings are called **valid anagrams** if:
- Both strings contain the **same characters**
- Each character appears the **same number of times**
- Only the **order of characters is different**


class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(t):
            return False
            
        freq = {}
        
        for i in s:
            if i not in freq:
                freq[i] = 1
            else:
                freq[i]+=1
        for i in t:
            if i not in freq:
                return False
            else:
                freq[i]-=1

        for i in freq.values():
            if i != 0:
                return False
        return True
